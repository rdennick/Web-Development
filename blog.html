	<h2>How Close Was DJ LeMahieu to Being MVP?</h2>

	<p class="quote">Ryan Dennick is a former Major League Baseball player for the Cincinnati Reds.  Over the course of his 8 year carrer, Ryan appeard in 342 games for three different organizations. He is currently retired and has started a new career with the Cincinnati Reds Community Fund.</p>

	<p>Over the course of a long baseball season, things can get pretty boring down in the bullpen, if you let it.  Especially when the bullpen is located beyond the outfield wall, it can be difficult at times to stay engaged when the action happening on the field is more than 300 feet away.  In an attempt to stay away from the monotonous, guys will throw out various discussion topics or hypotheticals to talk about. Sometimes those hypotheticals bordered on the extreme.   Since we were professional athletes, more times than not we would argue about sports.  So, let’s argue about sports.</p>

	<p>If you’re a sports fan and haven’t been living under a rock, you may have heard that Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson in the 1963-64 season to average a triple-double for an entire season.  Although the announcement of who will win the MVP award won’t be announced until June 26th, Vegas odds makers have made Westbrook a heavy favorite (-850 according to odds shark) to bring home the hardware despite equally impressive years from James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and LeBron James.</p>

	<p>Before this post begins to look like it belongs on Hoops Rumors more than MLB Trade Rumors, let me lay out the first hypothetical. What if Westbrook had 31 less assists and averaged 31 points / 10 rebounds /9 assists instead of 31/10/10?  Is the allure of averaging a triple-double so strong that most voters simply cannot deny Westbrook their vote? Would just leading the league in points per game have been enough or did he need to have” triple-double” attached to his name to make him the presumed MVP?  Does the one less assist per game weaken Russell Westbrook’s case just enough to allow James Harden to pass him because Harden’s team had a better record? Basically what I’m getting at is how much can MVP voters be swayed by flashy, historical stats?  Let’s try to put this into baseball context and see what side of the fence you’re on.</p>  

	<p>Borrowing from ESPN when making predictions on NCAA Tournament 	seeding, let’s do blind resumes for three players from the 2016 season:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Player #1: 176 hits, .369 wOBA, 8.4 fWAR</li>
		<li>Player #2: 184 hits, .408 wOBA, 5.5 fWAR</li>
		<li>Player #3: 221 hits, .423 wOBA, 6.4 fWAR</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Player one is Kris Bryant. Last season, he slashed .292/.385/.554 en route to running away with the National League MVP voting. In fact, it was nearly unanimous as he garnered 29 of the 30 first place votes.  Player two is Daniel Murphy. He got the remaining first place vote finishing a distant second while putting up a slash line of .347/.390/.595.  Player three is hypothetical DJ LeMahieu. But this version of LeMahieu has 29 outs changed to singles.  This would have been his slash line:</p>
	<p>.400/.463/.547</p>

	<p>There’s that flashy, historical stat:  .400.  No one in the game has hit .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. The game of baseball has seen a dramatic rise in the three true outcomes (walks, strikeouts and homeruns) in recent years.  Hitters are sacrificing batting average and strikeouts for homeruns. Balls are getting put in play less and less. I watched the entire Cubs-Yankees 18 inning marathon last Sunday night when a MLB record was set for strikeouts in a game. At one point, 10 straight hitters struck out.  A ball wasn’t put in play for nearly an hour.  The idea of someone hitting .400 seems like a pipe dream.</p> 

 	<p>Now, I know adding 29 singles is a pretty significant chunk of hits but it’s essentially one extra hit per week. However, even after the singles are sprinkled into DJ LeMahieu’s stat line, Kris Bryant still much better overall season according to fangraphs WAR. 8.4 fWAR for Bryant, 6.4 fWAR after calculating the extra singles for LeMahieu.  But in my opinion, LeMahieu was 29 singles from being MVP.  In terms of offensive production, He would have led the all of baseball in wOBA (.423), second in OPS (1.010) and third in WAR.  While those numbers alone probably aren’t good enough to earn MVP, especially with the fantastic overall season that Bryant had, it’s the aura the term <quote>“.400”</quote> has that puts him over the top.  And before someone throws out the argument <quote>“Well, he plays in Colorado.”</quote>, let me be clear: If any player hit .400, they are the MVP in my opinion.</p>  

	<p>First off, you can easily make the argument that its harder to hit for average today than it has been in the past.  Pitchers are throwing harder with much better stuff.  Relievers are specialized so hitters can see four different pitchers in a game. Defensive shifts have exploded exponentially to counter hitter’s tendencies.  Batting average itself has fallen out of vogue for front offices in exchange for higher OPS, higher strikeout hitters and the Players are going to adapt to where the money is, selling out for that higher OPS.</p>

	<p>Secondly, it seems like this would be an easy sell for the fans.  Baseball fans have been progressively getting smarter in understanding some of the more advanced metrics getting thrown around but there still can be confused at times as to what some metrics are attempting to measure.  The beauty in .400 is its simplicity.  All fans understand it.  They also understand it hasn’t been achieved in quite some time. I feel most fans would be on board with a .400 hitter being selected MVP.   Speaking of those advanced statistics, in today’s game we have much better metrics to figure out who has more value than who.  Kris Bryant clearly had more value than even the hypothetical DJ LeMahieu but my final argument lies with the people who actually pick an MVP: the voters</p>


	<p>As far as how the baseball writers would vote, you don’t even have to go back too far in past MVP voting for supporting evidence.  Back in 2012, Miguel Cabrera won the American League MVP over Mike Trout.  That season, Miguel Cabrera produced a 6.4 fWAR while Trout was worth more than 10 wins at 10.3 fWAR., a difference of nearly 4 wins.  But Miguel Cabrera won the Triple Crown that season, a flashy, historical stat that had not been achieved since Carl Yastrzemski did it for the Boston Red Sox in 1967.  In that season, the voters had spoken, and they said “do something historic, we will vote you MVP.” And they said it emphatically with 22 first place votes for Cabrera.</p>

	<p>So, where do you sit? Has baseball analytics taken over so much that you let the metrics tell you who the MVP is or can something that no one has achieved in 75 years allow that player to leap over those metrics?  As far as .400 goes, no one has really come close since Tony Gwynn hit .394 in 1994, but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun to speculate.

	<h2>You Only Get One MLB Debut</h2>
	<p class="quote">Ryan Dennick is a former Major League Baseball player for the Cincinnati Reds.  Over the course of his 8 year carrer, Ryan appeard in 342 games for three different organizations. He is currently retired and has started a new career with the Cincinnati Reds Community Fund.</p>

	<p>18,910.  This is the number of players who have made a major league debut in the history of the sport.  In life, you only get a few true indelible moments. For those 18k+ players, there is no doubt in my mind getting the call to the big leagues is one of them.  Every single player that has been lucky enough to beat incredible odds to reach the games highest level can tell you in vivid detail where they were, when it happened and the emotions that came with having a lifelong dream realized.  My name is Ryan Dennick.  I was 22nd round senior sign in the 2009 draft.   Six seasons later, I became number 18,360. This was my indelible moment.</p>

	<p>On August 31st 2014, Jonathan Broxton was traded from the Cincinnati Reds to the Milwaukee Brewers.  To most, this meant the Reds were shedding a little over $11MM in payroll commitment. For a team that was in desperate need of some salary relief, it was a move they had to make.  To the players in Triple-A Louisville’s clubhouse, this meant something completely different.  There was an open 40-man roster spot.</p>

	<p>When news of the trade broke, a bit of a buzz swept through the clubhouse. The move was completely unexpected and guys began to speculate who could fill the vacancy.   With rosters in the big leagues expanding from 25 to 40 the next day, that roster spot wouldn’t be vacant very long. Each year, you can give a pretty good guess on who most of the September call-ups are going to be. Players already on the 40-man roster in the upper minors obviously have the inside track to get the call since no roster move needs to be made.  Prospects that require being protected from the Rule-V draft the upcoming offseason could certainly find themselves in a Major League uniform come September.</p>

	<p>Then there are players like me.  The hardest call-ups to predict. The non-prospect, roster filler types that have their best statistical seasons. If a spot isn’t open on the 40-man, teams don’t often go out of their way to create an opening for a player that probably doesn’t fit into a team’s long term plans.  Instead, these players will be sent to the off-season with a pat on the backside for a job well done and perhaps an invite to Major League spring training the next season. Where a team is in the standings plays a factor as well.  Without the added pressure of staying in contention late in the season, teams out of the race may be more willing to reward these players with a call-up, if a roster spot is available. The Reds were the perfect storm.  Sitting with a record of 66-71, they were out of contention. When the Broxton trade happened, a roster spot opened up.  Every player in our clubhouse not currently on the 40-man roster was hoping that spot had their name on it.</p>

	<p>For a good majority of my minor league pitching career, I was quite mediocre statistically.  I was never great, never horrible either.  I had always shown enough promise to warrant filling a minor league roster spot but, in the eyes of those in the front office, I probably didn’t have enough “stuff” to reach the majors without great minor league numbers to force their hand. Of course, being left-handed helped me stick around, too. But I always believed I would reach the majors one day. Every minor leaguer does.  Otherwise we would be crazy to live the minor league lifestyle year after year if we didn’t think we could reach the carrot on the stick, even if it was just a nibble.</p> 

	<p>For whatever reason, a player can have a year where everything just goes right.  Something just clicks.  Pitchers see line drives hit right at fielders.  Hitters have more bloopers fall in for hits. 2014 was that year for me.  I was having easily the best season of my life.  Outing after outing, was building my case to force the Reds to make a decision on me.  A move from the starting rotation to the bullpen helped my fastball play up a little more and made my slider a little sharper.  Every bit helps.  By the end of the season, my 40-man roster spot resume included an unblemished record, a team low ERA, the league lead in appearances and the league lead in holds.  Seemingly every break went my way.  I was hoping for one more.</p>

	<p>On the morning of September 1st, I rolled into Louisville Slugger Field a little later than I normally do. I had just finished a long breakfast with my mom and fiancé at one of the local spots in downtown Louisville. I tried all I could to get my mind off what could be waiting for me when I arrived. I failed.  Expecting a call-up was an easy way to set yourself up for disappointment so I always tried to operate with the idea that if I was meant to be in the big leagues, somehow I would get there. But the Broxton trade cleared a path.  That spot has to go to someone, why not me? </p>

	<p>As I walk through the clubhouse doors, to the left I can already see our manager, Jim Riggleman, in his office letting the members of the 40-man roster know they are getting the call back to the majors.  Since I was one of the last players to arrive in the clubhouse, I set my bag down at my locker and took a quick look around the room looking for unbridled happiness from a player that earned the right to fill the open roster spot.  It doesn’t matter if a player has been to the big leagues before or not, when a teammate gets called up for the first time, it’s a special moment in the clubhouse.  Everyone stops what they are doing to offer handshakes and hugs in recognition of the hard work, dedication and sacrifice it takes to reach the games highest level. Major League jobs aren’t given away.  Every single one of them are earned. However, no such excitement was taking place. I left my locker to head towards the players’ lounge to try to get in a game of spades before heading out to the field to do my throwing program.  Right as I turn the corner, I was met by our pitching coach, Ted Power. “Where have you been! Skip wants to see you! Now!”</p>

	<p>When the manager wants to see you, it’s usually for one of three reasons.  You’re either going up, going down or going home.  It’s not to chit chat. As I made my way to Riggleman’s office, I passed another player who was just told he is returning to the big leagues.  We don’t say anything as we pass. He just shoots me a wink, as if he already knows what I’m about to walk into.  “Have a seat, Ryan” Jim says. I take a seat on the sofa in his office wondering if this is it.   Am I going up? Is he letting me know they decided not to call me up but he’s thanking me for a great season? My mind is racing so fast that I don’t realize he’s been talking for about ten seconds and I didn’t hear anything he said.  I snap out of it and zone back in to catch him say “So you’re going up to Cincinnati to finish out the season. Do you have any questions?” I sit in stunned silence, trying to process what has just been said to me.  I’ve waited my whole life to hear those words and now that I have, I don’t know what to do.  Years of low pay, validated.  Years of subpar housing, validated. Years of crammed 12-hour bus rides, validated.  Years of eating more peanut butter and jelly than is recommended in a life time, validated.  “…No” I said. I could barely eek that out.  “Ok then get out of here, Jimmy (the trainer) has your itinerary.” I leave his office and right around the corner is the player I passed on my way in.  “Yeah??” he asks, referring to me being called up or not. I nod my head. “Yeah…” He turns to go into the clubhouse. “We got a first timer here!” he shouts.  Handshakes and hugs all around.  I just became a 27-year-old rookie.</p>
